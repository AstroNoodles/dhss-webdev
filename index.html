        <h2>Miscellaneous Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="fun-facts">Max is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Crested_Dog" target="_new">Chinese Crested</a> 
                and is one of the few types of hairless dogs that exist. There also exists a <em>powderpuff</em> version
            of the Chinese Crested and it usually wins dog grooming and fashion competitions.</li>
            <li class="fun-facts">Spanish explorers found the Chinese Crested in Mexico and parts of Central and South America as early as in the 1500s.
                Europeans found the breed in Africa in the 1700s.
            </li>
            <li class="fun-facts">He likes to hang out with his brother Ringo, an American <strong id="orange-span">orange</strong> tabby. He's been here since the owner
                was 7 years old!
            </li>
            <li class="fun-facts">If my mom would have her way, we would also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphynx_cat" target="_new">Sphinx cat</a> in the house 
                so we wouldn't have to clean for fur so often. It is the only hairless cat breed that exists, along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donskoy_cat" target="_new">Donkskoy Cat</a>.
